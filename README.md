# parallel-sentences
On November 15, 2025, I completed the shared file with parallel sentences by adding my Karachay-Balkar translations of 51 sentences (29 from cairo and 22 from udtw23). The remaining 97 sentences are in progress.
The Karachay-Balkar language has two dialects (Karachay and Balkar) that differ approximately like American and British English. The main differences between the Karachay and Balkar dialects are:
  1. Alternation of "Дж" and "Ж" at the beginning of words;
  2. Alternation of "Б" and "П" at the end of verbal adverbs and certain nouns;
  3. Metathesis and elision;
  4. Minor lexical variations.

For the purposes of this work, we decided not to create two separate translation variants, but to make a unified (mixed) variant. In this unified translation variant, for point 1, the symbol "J" is used throughout, which can easily be replaced with "Дж" or "Ж" if desired. For point 2, the letter "Б" is used. For point 3, more common and full forms are used. For point 4, more common forms from both dialects are used.
